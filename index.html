								<p><strong>Topic: </strong>Automated essay scoring<br><strong>Institute:</strong> Shandong University of Finance and Economics<br><strong>Start-end time: </strong>6/2023 - 8/2024<br>As part of a research project on automated essay evaluation, I collected and processed over 20,000 high school essays using Python for NLP training. I collaborated with the research team to develop a model inspired by GPT and diffusion-based architectures, contributing to data preparation and evaluation pipeline optimization. This experience enhanced my understanding of language model design and efficient data-driven research workflows.</p>

								<h3>Interactive Mapper</h3>
								<p>In our ECE297 project, I led my team of three to develop an interactive map application using C++ in Linux environment. This collaborative effort spanned a full semester, showcasing our ability to deliver a complex, real-world software solution.</p>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p><strong>Here is a demo to the Mapper software.</strong></p>
								<p>By using C++, Git, and Linux environments, my interactive map has achieved several features including basic searching functionality, designing different themes, and several user-friendly functions etc. The developing process involves first extracting data within the OSM (Open Street Map) and storing them by unordered set for further usage. After this, by employing the EZGL API, I successfully visualized the map information on the screen, including basic features (streets, sea, buildings, etc.) plotted by different layers, also the street names shown in appropriate positions. Lastly, I use priority queue to achieve the Dijska hence A* Algorithm to design my shortest path function, also have a 2-opt algorithm for the function that enables couriers to check the shortest path of pick up and drop off multiple deliveries.</p>

								<h3>Meowgle</h3>
								<p>Customized Search Engine</p>
								<p>In this project, my team developed a playful yet functional search engine named Meowgle (“Meow” + “Google”), built with Python for both frontend and backend components. The system allows users to search any term on a web interface, automatically counting word occurrences and storing search history. With features like Google Account login, personalized history sync, and an anonymous browsing mode, Meowgle provides a smooth and engaging user experience while maintaining a clean and minimal web interface.</p>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p><strong>Here is a demo to the Search Engine web page.</strong></p>
								<p>For this web development lab, I implemented the frontend of a search platform using Python and Google Authorizer. The application enables users to log in with their Google accounts, retrieve their top searches, and sync history across multiple devices. Anonymous users can also access a temporary view with automatically cleared data after exit. This project strengthened my understanding of web architecture, user authentication, and the importance of designing seamless user flows.</p>

										<h3>Quick sketches</h3>
										<p>This exquisite collection showcases the elegance of the Baimiao style, a traditional Chinese artistic technique known for its simplicity and grace. Each piece captures the essence of its subject with minimal yet powerful strokes, focusing on the purity of lines without the distraction of colors. The subjects are all real individuals, and are rendered with an extraordinary level of detail and emotional depth, revealing their unique personalities and stories. The artist's mastery of the Baimiao technique breathes life into these sketches, making each character appear both ethereal and vividly present. This collection is a testament to the beauty of simplicity and the power of a single line to convey the complexity of the human spirit.</p>
